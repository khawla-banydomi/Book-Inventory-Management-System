+ Problem statement:

There is a famous saying in the world ( tell me how number of valuable books you have and then I tell you who are you ) depend on that I have numerous amount of books in my house  ; islamic, historical, scientific and more; also I have a huge number of stories in different languages:(Arabic, English and Spanish) related to my kids; a lot of my friends ask my to read some of my books and then return them back to me after finishing (lent) ; additionally I used to buy new books that might add a new value to me or to my family; so for example when some body ask me if I have this book or not I used to go a head and start searching for that book because I am not sure if I already have it or not; moreover; frequently a lot number of friends who borrowed my books forget to return them back to me; based on that I have to find effecient way to keep track on my books.


+ Solution :

The most effective way that can be used to help me keeping track of my books is (Deverloping Inventory-management-system) ; so I have to include the whole books that I have in my house in this Inventory; when anybody (borrow) any book just I update the state of the book(borrowed) and update the borrowing date; then modify the state when it is already returned back; sometimes when I find an important book of course with a good price I have to buy it thus; this new book have to included in the developed (Inventory) system.

+ Inventory-Importance:

There are  several advantages that can be gained by developing the inventory stsytem :
1. organization: instead of search here or there to know if you have a book or not you just check the inventory.
2. Time saving: one click that updates the state of the book saves minutes of searching.
3. reduce headache: it is used instead of human memory so that it will reduce the load over the memory.


*The best tool that can be used to develop the project is ANGULAR 8.0 + versions.
